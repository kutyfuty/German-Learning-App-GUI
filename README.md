A vocabulary learning application tailored for **German** learners. Based on the Leitner system (Flash Card method), it helps users memorize the most frequent German words efficiently.

## ✨ Features
* **Top 100 Frequent Words:** Starts with a curated list of essential German words (`german_words.csv`).
* **Progress Tracking:** Automatically removes known words from the deck so you focus on what you don't know.
* **Audio Pronunciation:** (Eğer eklediysen) Uses Text-to-Speech to read the German words aloud for better pronunciation practice.
* **Interactive GUI:** Flip cards to see the English translation after a delay.
